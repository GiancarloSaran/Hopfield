## Introduction
Hopfield networks are a type of recurrent artificial neural network that can serve as content-addressable memory systems. This project explores the concept of incorporating sleep phases into the Hopfield network to enhance its performance and stability.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.7+
- NumPy

## Installation
To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

## Usage
To train and test the Hopfield network with sleep, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
